4. Please elaborate an example of OCR usage for document understanding

In the context of document understanding, OCR is used to capture, extract, and process data from various types of documents. This involves reading, interpreting, and extracting information from the written text. 

For example, OCR can process the image to identify the text and create a hidden layer of text and behind the image. This additional layer can be easily read by a computer, thus making the image recognizable and searchable.
