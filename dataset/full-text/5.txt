5.How are the common architectures of text detection and text recognition models?

The common architectures of text detection and recognition models often involve deep learning techniques. Two major approaches are CTC based and attention based. 

These models are trained to identify the shapes of characters or numbers on an image to recognize the text in the image. They can then reconstruct the extracted text in a machine readable format.
